NOTE: WINDOWS XP IS NOT SUPPORTED AND NEVER WILL BE.

    C# WPF MVVM architecture
    Plays 4K video
    Runs without any video codecs installed
    Integrates with IMDB and subtitle services (unfinished)
    Supports external themes (unfinished)
    UI can look nice and animate (unfinished)
    Vista/7/8 taskbar integration (mostly finished)

Still in experimental phase / not optimized / buggy / unfinished, but if someone wants to try (Vista+ and .Net 3.5Sp1 required, and Media Feature pack if on Windows "N" versions):

Todo list:

    Drag&drop support from explorer (media / subs)
    Implement missing subtitle features
    Implement audio output device selection
    Implement audio stream selection
    Playlist
    Finish main theme/skin
    Finish plain windows theme
    Localization
    Bugfixes
    Optimization / Usability
    Installer for 64 bit version
    Code review
    Portable version (to run as single exe)

Ideas and feedback welcome!ï»¿
